	<h1>Backtracking</h1>

	<p >Copyright &#169;2002 by David Matizek</p>
   
	<p>
		Backtracking is a form of recursion.
	</p>

	<p>
		The usual scenario is that you are
		 faced with a number of options, and you 
		 must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of 
		 options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This 
		 procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a 
		 good sequence of choices, your final state is a <i>goal state;</i> if you didn't, it isn't.
	</p>

	<p>
		Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and 
		some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get
		 to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, 
		 and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can <i>backtrack</i> to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your
		 <em>most recent</em> choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke 
		 the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, 
		 there are no good leaves to be found.
	</p>

	<p>This needs an example.</p>
    <center><img src="imagesb/tree.jpeg" alt="tree image"></center>
<br>
<ol>
	<li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
    <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
	<li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
	<li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
	<li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
	<li>
		At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.
	</li>
	<li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
	<li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
	<li>E is good. Congratulations!	</li>
</ol>

<p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called <i>depth-first tree searching.</i>)
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>The backtracking algorithm.</h3>

<p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node n:</p>

<font  size="3.5en" style="" color="maroon" >
	
	<blockquote>
	 <pre style="font-family: verdana;" >
	  
boolean solve(Node n) {
	if n is a leaf node {
			if the leaf is a goal node, return true
		else return false
	} else {
		for each child c of n {
			if solve(c) succeeds, return true
		}
	return false
    }
}

	</pre>
	</blockquote>
</font>
	<p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a <i>boolean</i> function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If <font color="maroon">solve(n)</font>  
	is true, that means node <font color="maroon">n</font> is part of a solution--that is, node nis one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that <font color="maroon">n</font> is <i>solvable.</i> If <font color="maroon">solve(n) </font> is false, then there is <i>no</i> path that includes <font color="maroon">n</font> to any goal node.</p>
	<p>How does this work?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If any child of <font color="maroon">n</font>  is solvable, then <font color="maroon">n</font>  is solvable.</li>
		<li>If no child of <font color="maroon">n</font>  is solvable, then <font color="maroon">n</font>  is not solvable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node <font color="maroon">n</font>  is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any child of <font color="maroon">n</font>  is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of <font color="maroon">n</font> . In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>

<blockquote>
	<font  size="3.5en" style="" color="maroon" >
	
	
		 <pre style="font-family: verdana;" >
for each child c of n {
    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
}
return false

	</pre>

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>

<font  size="3.5en" style="" color="maroon" >
	<pre style="font-family: verdana;">
	if n is a leaf node {
		if the leaf is a goal node, return true
		else return false
	}
	
</pre>
</font>

<p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To search a tree:
	</li><br>
	<ol><li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node,
	</li>
<li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.
</li></ol>
</ul>

<h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
<p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.</p>

<blockquote>
<font  size="3.5en" style="" color="maroon" >
	<pre style="font-family: verdana;">
boolean solve(Node n) {
	put node n on the stack;
	while the stack is not empty {
	   if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
		 if it is a goal node, return true
			else pop it off the stack
	}
	else {
		if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
			push the next untried child onto the stack
		else pop the node off the stack
	
	}
	return false
}
		</pre>
		</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.

</p>
<p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node.</p>

<p>
	Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or storing it in an array.

</p>
<p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<font  size="3.5en" style="" color="maroon" >
		<pre style="font-family: verdana;">
boolean solve(Node n) {
	if n is a leaf node {
	   if the leaf is a goal node {
		  print n
		  return true
		}
		else return false
	  } else {
		for each child c of n {
			if solve(c) succeeds {
				print n
				return true
			   }
			}
			return false
		   }
		 }
</pre>
</font>
	</blockquote>

<h3>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h3>
<p>I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles and the same number of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of <code><font size="4en" color="maroon"> 2n+1</font></code> spaces to put the marbles in. Start with the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.</p>
<p>
	Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to print out the bad news.
</p>
<p>
	The backtracking method is named <code><font size="4en" color="maroon">  solvable</font></code> and 
	returns a<code><font size="4en" color="maroon">   boolean</font></code>. 
	In <code><font size="4en" color="maroon">  solvable</font></code> we shall need to check whether 
	we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from
	 which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.


</p>
<p>
	Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.
</p>
<p>
	Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid approach.
</p>
<p>
	First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.
</p>
<p>
	Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.
</p>
<p>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order,
	 the <code><font size="4en" color="maroon">  2n+1 </font></code>
	spaces of the board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible.
	 
	 With this understanding, we can write a boolean method 
	 <code><font size="4en" color="maroon"> canMove(int[] board, int position)</font></code>
	  which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		If the position is empty, no move is possible;

	</li>
	<li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;
		
		</li>
		<li>
			If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.
		</li>
</ul>

<p>We write another method <code><font size="4en" color="maroon">int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</font></code> that will take a board and a
	 position, make a move from that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat
	  more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with 
	  simplicity.) In technical jargon,<code><font size="4en" color="maroon"> makeMove</font></code> makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative."</p>

<p>With these methods, our central backtracking method can be written as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<font  size="3.5en" style="" color="maroon" >
	<pre style="font-family: verdana;">
boolean solvable(int[] board) {
	if (puzzleSolved(board)) {
		return true;
	}
	for (int position = 0; position &lt; BOARD_SIZE; position++) {
		if (canMove(board, position)) {
			int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position);
			if (solvable(newBoard)) {
				printBoard(newBoard);
				return true;
			}
		}
	}
	return false;
}
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

	<p>Along with <code><font size="4en" color="maroon">canMove</font></code> and <code><font size="4en" color="maroon">makeMove</font></code>, we are using methods <code><font  size= 4en color="maroon">puzzleSolved</font></code> and <code><font size="4en" color="maroon">printBoard </font></code>with meanings that should be obvious.

	</p>
<p>Here is some output from the program:</p>
	<pre style="font-family: verdana;" reversed="true" >
<font color="blue"><i>16.</i></font><b>  WHITE  WHITE  WHITE  _____  BLACK  BLACK  BLACK</b>
<font color="blue"><i>15.</i></font><b>  WHITE  WHITE  WHITE  BLACK  _____  BLACK  BLACK</b>
<font color="blue"><i>14.</i></font><b>  WHITE  WHITE  _____  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  BLACK</b>
<font color="blue"><i>13.</i></font><b>  WHITE  _____  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  BLACK</b>
<font color="blue"><i>12.</i></font><b>  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE  _____  WHITE  BLACK  BLACK</b>
<font color="blue"><i>11.</i></font><b>  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE  _____  BLACK</b>
<font color="blue"><i>10.</i></font><b> WHITE  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  _____</b>
<font color="blue"><i> 9.</i></font><b>  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  _____  BLACK  WHITE</b>
<font color="blue"> <i>8.</i></font><b>  WHITE  BLACK  _____  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE</b>
<font color="blue"><i> 7.</i></font><b>  _____  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE</b>
<font color="blue"> <i>6.</i></font><b>  BLACK  _____  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE</b>
<font color="blue"><i> 5.</i></font><b>  BLACK  BLACK  WHITE  _____  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE</b>
<font color="blue"> <i>4.</i></font><b>  BLACK  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  WHITE  _____  WHITE</b>
<font color="blue"><i> 3.</i></font><b>  BLACK  BLACK  WHITE  BLACK  _____  WHITE  WHITE</b>
<font color="blue"><i> 2.</i></font><b>  BLACK  BLACK  _____  BLACK  WHITE  WHITE  WHITE</b>
<font color="blue"><i> 1.</i></font><b>  BLACK  BLACK  BLACK  _____  WHITE  WHITE  WHITE</b>
</pre>

<p>
	Notice that the solution is given in reverse order:
	 BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, 
	 as in the last line. I've added line numbers to the actual output 
	 in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its results 
	 (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to
	  reverse the results 
	again to get them in the correct order.
